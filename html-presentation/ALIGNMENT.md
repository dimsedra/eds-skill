# Alignment & Grilling Protocol

Interactive prep session guide for discovering presentation intent, sifting raw human thoughts, structuring the storyline, and locking in design decisions before generating slide code.

## Core Posture: The Sifter & Mirror Pattern

Human thinking is exploratory, unstructured, and messy. When the user blurts out raw thoughts, half-formed ideas, or rambling context:
- **Never force rigid forms**: Do not demand bullet points or interrogate the user with rigid checklists.
- **Sift the stream**: Actively parse the raw input to extract: (1) Core Topic & Setting, (2) Audience Profile & Baseline Mindset, (3) 1-Sentence Core Takeaway ("Big Idea"), and (4) Specific raw slide ideas or anecdotes.
- **Reflect a structured mirror**: Synthesize the extracted pieces into a clean draft sequence of **Action Headlines** and reflect it back to the user in plain English for confirmation.
- **Living Blueprint for Narrative Surgery**: `STORYLINE.md` is a living document. Whenever narrative points, arguments, or slide claims are added, cut, or shifted during iteration, update `STORYLINE.md` first to keep the storyline spine coherent.

## 1. The 4-Pass Funnel Alignment Dialogue

Structure the alignment as a funnel—moving from wide, loose exploration down to precise narrative and visual decisions. Ask questions strictly **one pass per message turn**; wait for response before advancing.

### Pass 1: The Open Brain Dump (Wide & Loose)
*Goal: Give the user full freedom to dump raw thoughts without interrogation pressure.*
- **Opening Invitation**: *"What do you have in mind for this presentation? Feel free to dump your raw thoughts, topic, target audience, rough ideas, or any specific points you want to cover."*
- **Sifting Task**: Actively parse the user's raw stream to extract tentative topic, audience angle, core thesis, and any specific slide anecdotes.

### Pass 2: Sift & Clarify (Target Missing Context)
*Goal: Mirror the extracted core back to the user and clarify only what's missing.*
- **Mirror**: Reflect back the synthesized topic and takeaway:
  *"Here is what I'm hearing: the core message is [1-sentence synthesis], aimed at [audience]."*
- **Targeted Clarification**: Ask only for missing parameters:
  *"To sharpen this: Is this presented live with you speaking (visual punch), or sent as a standalone read-ahead document? Roughly how many slides are we aiming for (e.g. 5-slide brief vs. 10-slide walkthrough)?"*

### Pass 3: Storyline & Slide Content Framework (Pure Narrative Lock)
*Goal: Validate and lock the slide-by-slide narrative and presentation strategy ("how to present this content") before discussing visuals.*
- **Action Headlines & Strategy Proposal**: Present the synthesized Slide Content Framework:
  - *Slide 1: [Hero Title & Subtitle]* — How to present: **Hero Statement**
  - *Slide 2: [Action Headline: Core problem / context]* — How to present: **Side-by-Side Comparison**
  - *Slide 3: [Action Headline: Core proposal / mechanism]* — How to present: **Architecture Flow Diagram**
  - *Slide 4: [Action Headline: Proof / Architecture / Data]* — How to present: **Metric Cards Grid**
  - *Slide 5: [Action Headline: Next steps / Call to action]* — How to present: **Call to Action Callout**
- **Validation Prompt**: *"Does this headline flow and presentation approach capture what you want to communicate, or should we adjust any slide?"*
- **Scaffold**: Write the approved narrative blueprint into `STORYLINE.md` in the presentation root.

### Pass 4: Visual Styling & Theme (Look & Feel)
*Goal: Lock visual aesthetics once the storyline is settled.*
- **Prompt**: *"What visual tone and palette fits best for this deck? (e.g., Dark modern engineering with cyan accent, Clean editorial light with slate blue, or custom brand colors)?"*
- **Scaffold**: Write the approved design tokens into `DECK-DESIGN.md` in the presentation root.
